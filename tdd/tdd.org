* Testing/QA (Quality Assurance)

* Testing
  - what is a test?
  - why do we need tests?
    - verification that it works as expected
    - sanity checks
    - input validation
    - bounds check
    - stress/load test
    - regression testing
    - automated tests reduce human error
    - refactoring

* TDD
  - write tests first. they will fail
  - make them pass. see your module come to life
  - writing tests first help define your module's API

* Coverage
  - what is test coverage
  - all conditional branches are executed
  - the danger of 100% coverage

* Profiling
  - statement profiling
  - CPU profiling
  - Memory profiling
  - QA should consider profiling as part of the process

* Benchmarking
  - compare implementations
  - know how fast your functions run. feel good.
